  - General AI (Strong AI)
    - Machines that could potentially replicate human cognitive capabilities across a wide range of tasks
  - Super AI
    - Hypothetical stage where machines surpass human intelligence in all aspects

- The more data a system processes, the better it becomes at adapting to dynamic enviornments

- Early AI research was focused on symbolic reasoning
  - Problems were represented using symbols and logical rules
  
- Expert Systems
  - Combined rule based logic with specific domain knowledge to solve specialized problems
